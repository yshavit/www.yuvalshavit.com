- You can try out the first program I ever had published! It's called The Teleporting Inchworm, and I wrote it when I was 14. I submitted it to MacAddict, and they included it on one of their CDs that accompanied their magazine — I thought that was the coolest thing ever! Now, with the magic of emulators, you can [run it in your browser](inchworm).
